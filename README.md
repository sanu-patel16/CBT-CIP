LIBRARY CATALOG SYSTEM:

This is a simple console-based library catalog system where users can add, search, and list books.

Users can manage a collection of books, including adding new books, searching by title or author, and listing all available books 




BANKY:

BankY is a simulation of a basic banking system that allows users to create accounts, deposit and withdraw funds, and transfer funds between accounts. This project provides an opportunity to explore fundamental concepts of object- oriented programming, data persistence using files or databases, and basic transaction handling.
